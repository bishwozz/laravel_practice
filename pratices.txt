1. Can you explain the difference between Eloquent ORM 
    and Query Builder in Laravel, and when you might choose one over the other?

    Yes, Query Builder is indeed faster because it’s closer to raw SQL,
     avoiding the overhead of object creation in Eloquent. But Eloquent’s features,
      like relationships, scopes, and mutators/accessors, offer great advantages
       for complex applications where these abstractions make code more readable and maintainable.
